## Introduction
<strong>Multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.</strong>

<br/>This is possible thanks to the use of JavaScript and the virtual DOM.  
The navigation menu is built gradually as you add sections to the HTML document. There is also a function that allows you to move from the bottom to the top of the page and a function where the user clicks on the navigation element to scroll to the appropriate section.

## Installation 
No installation needed. After cloning the repository, the project is supported by modern browsers. 

## Room for Improvement
* Simplification of JavaScript functions
* Adding a hamburger menu
* Breaking down the styles.css file into smaller modular files: button.css, nav.css, footer.css
