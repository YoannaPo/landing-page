## Intoduction
<strong>Multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.</strong>

<br/>This is possible thanks to the use of JavaScript and the virtual DOM.  
The navigation menu is built gradually as you add sections to the HTML document. There is also a function that allows you to move from the bottom to the top of the page and a function where the user clicks on the navigation element to scroll to the appropriate section.
